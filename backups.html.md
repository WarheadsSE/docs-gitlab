# Backups

Backups of the configuration and repository data are not currently automated.

You can execute the included rake tasks manually in order to backup your configuration and data by following these steps.

## SSH Into the GitLab VMs

Follow the instructions [here](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) on how to SSH into your Ops Manager VM.

Once you SSH in, identify the GitLab deployment by running `bosh deployments` and look for the deployment with `gitlab-ee` in the name.

You can then target that deployment by following [these steps](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#product)

Next, SSH into the `gitlab-ee` job by following [these steps](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh). You can choose index `0` of the `gitlab-ee` job to connect to.

## Execute Backups

Once you connected via SSH, follow the instructions detailed [here](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#create-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system) on how to execute the backup and upload it to a remote location such as S3.
