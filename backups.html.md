TODO: Add documentation explaining how to SSH into the GitLab VMs / deployment and manually run a backup using the provided rake tasks.

Should cover how to configure the S3 details with links to the GitLab docs.
Required screenshots etc as well
List what is actually backed up (e.g. data from NFS, config, MySQL? Redis?)
