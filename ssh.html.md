TODO: Add documentation explaining how to `git push` via SSH.

Showing how to identify the IP of the first GitLab VM from OpsManager and which ports should be opened on the firewall.

In the future when this is changed to a URL, the `git remote` details on any cloned repo's will need to be updated. List the command required to do this.

Detail the host key considerations as well, and link to documentation on the GitLab website on how to add a SSH key to your user profile to connect. 

Add a note explaining this is on the roadmap to be integrated into PCF in the future so this manual workaround is not required.

Port 2222
