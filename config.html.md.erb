## GitLab Configuration

These settings are used for the configuration of the GitLab application, and related security services.

## Properties

### Route Name

Defaults to `gitlab`. This route is registered against the apps domain configured on the runtime tile. The URL is used to access the GitLab web interface. Only HTTPS connections are accepted, and attempts to connect over HTTP are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

### Emails From

The address to be used when sending e-mail from GitLab, such as `gitlab-no-reply@my-pcf.example.com`.

### Emails Reply-To

The reply to address to be used

### Emails Display Name

A "friendly" name shown to users in their Inboxes.

### Initial root password

Password to pre-configure for the `root` user upon deployment of a new installation. This is not required, and will not be used during upgrades.

### Enable Rack Attack

Checkbox for enabling Rack Attack for this deployment. Defaults to checked. Only disable if other security measures are in place.

### SSH Extra Configuration

This `text` field allows for the input of a snippet that will be appened to the `sshd_config` by OpenSSH's `sshd` used by GitLab for access via SSH. The field is _not validated_, so it is left to the user to ensure that all content is valid according to the [man(5) page for `sshd_config`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/sshd_config.5.html).

The intent of this field is to allow for the configuration of security parameters for the SSH daemon such as `Ciphers`, `MACs`, and `KexAlgorithms`. The default values are those currently implemented in by the Ubuntu Trusty (14.04.5 LTS) package, as seen below.

```
Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1
```
